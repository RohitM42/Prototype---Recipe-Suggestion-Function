Submission:

short report : It should also include a short report that briefly summarises (no more than 200 words)

another report :what was accomplished and discusses in detail how it was accomplished (no more than 800 words)

This report may include any supporting material that
demonstrates the software engineering techniques you employed that is not already
included as part of the archive of your code repository. For example, screenshots of
issues demonstrating how you planned and provided updates on work.

ach member of the group should individually write around half a page
(roughly 250 words) of reflections on every other group member. The reflections
should be constructive in nature and you should be happy to share them with the
individual they are about. Assume that, rather than being students at a university,
you are colleagues at a workplace and that the end of the module or group project
is not the end of your working relationship. What would you suggest to your
“colleague” so that working with them will continue to be productive in the future or
become productive? 


For example, for a group with three members (Students A, B, and C), you would
have a report comprised of:
• 200 word summary of which EDR was chosen, any changes made, and what
was accomplished overall.
• 800 word report on how the prototype was accomplished, with an emphasis
on demonstrating aspects of the group work that aren’t reflected in the code
repository.
• Student A
– 250 words of reflections about Student B
– 250 words of reflections about Student C
• Student B
– 250 words of reflections about Student A
– 250 words of reflections about Student C
• Student C
– 250 words of reflections about Student A
– 250 words of reflections about Student B
